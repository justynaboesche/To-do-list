## Demo

## Description
This is my next project created in the process of becoming the **Frontend Developer**. I have created a simple to-do list that allows you to add new tasks to the list below,
mark completed tasks and remove tasks from the list.
## How it works
At the beginning you need to enter your amount of money in PLN, then you can select the currency from the list you want to convert into. To get the result, you need to click the 'Przelicz' button. If you want to reset the amount in PLN and the result, you can click the 'Wyczyść' button.  
[Click here](https://justynaboesche.github.io/to-do-list/) and convert your amount of money in PLN into one of the selected currencies!
